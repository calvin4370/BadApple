Instructions to use
-------------------
Viewport Settings:
160 by 45 characters is the default viewport size and can comfortably compute the default badapple.mp4 in real time
Setting the viewport to 320 by 75 characters is possible for good systems
Anything higher may lead to lower than original fps and thus audio syncing issues

Note these options are tested with the 360p, 30fps badapple.mp4 video
